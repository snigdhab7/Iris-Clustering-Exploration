#### GaussianMixture Analysis 📊

Experience the exploration! Applying the GaussianMixture algorithm to a subset of the Iris dataset, we unravel clusters and unveil fascinating insights.

**Highlights:**
- Leveraged the first two features of the Iris dataset for a refined analysis.
- Utilized GaussianMixture with 4 components, revealing distinct clusters.
- Assigned labels to each cluster, providing a clear view of the data patterns.

**Revelations:**
- Cluster 0 (🔴 Red petals) displayed unique characteristics.
- Cluster 1 (💛 Yellow petals) stood out with its distinctive features.
- Cluster 2 (💚 Green petals) exhibited intriguing patterns.

**Insights:**
- Converged log-likelihood value: *To be revealed during the analysis.*
- The analysis unfolded over *an undisclosed number of iterations.*
