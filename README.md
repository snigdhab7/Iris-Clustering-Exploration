# Unveiling the Secrets of Iris Petals with Gaussian Magic ðŸŒºâœ¨

In the magical realm of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, I embarked on a journey to decipher the hidden patterns within the mystical Iris dataset. Armed with GaussianMixture, a spellbinding algorithm, I summoned clusters from the depths of the data. Let the petals unfold!

## Project 1: Illuminating the Iris Mystery

### Dataset: [Dataset1.csv](link_to_dataset1)

#### Sol(1)(i): GaussianMixture Conjuring Act

Behold the spectacle! In my enchanted laboratory, I invoked the GaussianMixture spell on a subset of the revered Iris dataset. The stage was set, and the dancers (data points) twirled in a captivating display.

**Key Highlights:**
- Utilized the first two features of the Iris dataset (because why not start with a touch of elegance).
- Cast the GaussianMixture spell with 4 components, conjuring clusters from the data.
- Assigned labels to each dancer, revealing the enchanting patterns.

**Colorful Revelations:**
- Red petals (cluster 0) swayed gracefully.
- Yellow petals (cluster 1) pirouetted in the spotlight.
- Green petals (cluster 2) performed a mesmerizing dance.

**Magical Insights:**
- Converged log-likelihood value: [Insert Enigmatic Number Here]
- Witnessed the mystical ritual over [Number of Iterations] iterations.
